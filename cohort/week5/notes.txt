Why React?

- People realsised it's hard to do DOM manipulation the conventional way
- There were libraries that came into picture that made it sligghtly easy, butstill for a very big app it's very hard(jQuery)
- Eventually, VueJs/React created a new syntax to do frontends
- Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to hmtl,css and js


Some react jargons - 


- state                              - components


what is state: 
- An object that represents the current state of the app 
- It represnet tht dynamic things in your app (things that changed)
