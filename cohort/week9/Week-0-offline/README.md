# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### *About useEffect()*
 In this session  we will study about useeffect
 Side effects are operations that interac twith teh outside world or have effects beyong the component's rendering. Examples include:
 -Fetching data from an API.
 - Modifying the DOM manually
 - Subscribbing to events (like WebScketes connetions, timers, or browser events).
 -Starting a clock


- if you want to run a code only one like api call or any other side effect like set interval call then we have to use useeffect to do so.
