--- Monogo DB----

mongoose --> define your schma

mongoose is a library used to access mongodb db via express on top of node js

- In mongooose first you have to define the schema
- This sounds counter intuitive since mognodb is schemaless?
- That is true, but mongoose makes you define schmea for thing like autocompletions/ validating data before it goes in the DB to make sure you're doing things right 
- Schemaless dbs can be very dangerous, using schmeas in mongo makes it slightly less dangerous.
