# In this Week, We Will Be Learning About Monorepo and Turborepo

## What are Monorepos?
Monorepos are repositories that contain multiple packages or projects within a single repository, facilitating shared resources and centralized management.

### Why Monorepos?
- **Shared Code Reuse**: Simplifies code sharing across projects.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improves teamwork by centralizing the codebase.
- **Optimized Builds and CI/CD**: Tools like Turborepo offer smart caching and task execution strategies, significantly reducing build and testing times.
- **Centralized Tooling and Configuration**: Simplifies management of build tools, linters, formatters, and other configurations by having a unified setup for the entire project.

## Build System
A build system automates the process of transforming source code written by developers into executable binary code.

### Key Functions:
- **Transpilation**: Converting TypeScript (TS) to JavaScript (JS).
- **Code Bundling**: Packaging code for production.
- **Additional Tasks**: Running tests, linting, and deploying applications.

---

## Build System Orchestrator
Turborepo acts as a **build system orchestrator**, focusing on managing tasks rather than directly performing build operations like transpilation or bundling.

### Features:
- **Task Execution**: Allows defining tasks in your monorepo that invoke tools like `tsc`, `vite`, etc., to perform specific actions.
- **Task Management**: Ensures efficient coordination of various tools and processes.

---

## Monorepo Framework
A monorepo framework provides tools and conventions for managing multiple packages or applications within a single repository.

### Key Features:
- **Dependency Management**: Handles interdependencies between packages.
- **Workspace Configuration**: Simplifies setup and maintenance of workspaces.

## Turborepo as a Build System Orchestrator
Turborepo is a robust build system orchestrator designed for monorepos.

### Features:
1. **Caching**: Reduces redundant work by reusing previous results.
2. **Parallelization**: Executes tasks concurrently to save time.
3. **Dependency Graph Awareness**: Optimizes task execution based on dependency relationships.
