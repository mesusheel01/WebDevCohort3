What is github?

- GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repos.

- You can use git wihtout github, but you cannot use github without git.

req:
 -local repository
 - working directory and staging area or index.

Basic workflow of git.

step1- You modify a file from the working directory

step2- You add these files to the staging area.

step3- You perform commit opoeration that mov3es the files from the staging area. After push opoeration, it stores the changes permanently to the git repoitory.

                      _  working directory
                     |  
                  git add 
                        |
                         - staging area _   
                                         | 
                                        git commit
                                         |
                            repository  -
                        

Blobs - Blob stand for binary large object. Each version o a file is represented by blob.  A blob holds the file data but doesn't contain any metadata about the file. It is a binary file, and in git database, it is names as SHA1 hash of that file. in git, files are not addressed by names. Everything is content-addresssed.

Trees - Tee is an object which represnets a directory. it holds bolobs as well as other sub-directories. A tree is a binary file taht store s refrences to blobs and trees which are also named as SHA1 hash of the tree object.



Commits : 
          
        -> Commit holds the current state of the repository. A commit is also named by   SHA1 hash.
        -> Commit object =  a node of linked list.
        -> Every commit object has a pointer to the parent commit object. 
        ->: From a given comit, you can travers e back by looking at the parent pointer to view the history of the Commit.
