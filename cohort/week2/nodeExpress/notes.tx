e.g. Think of them as functions, where arguments are something the client sends, rather thn caling a functino userig its name, the client uses a URL, rather than the functino body, the server does something with the request , rather than the fucntion returning a value, the server responds with some data.

      - (address (url/ports))
http: - (route)

-: Things that happen in your browser after you fire this request :
    1. Browser parses the url 
    2. Does a DNS lookup (conversts google.com to an IP)
    3. Esatblishes a conection to the IP


What is DNS resolution?

-: URls are just like contacts in your phone
   In the end, they map to an IP 
   If you every buy a url of your own, you will need to point it to the IP of your server.



Things that happen on your server after the request is recieved:
          You get the inputs(route, body, headers)
          You do some logic on the input, calculate the output
          You return the output body, headers and status code.

      - Before we proceed, lets add contrainsts to our route :
      1. User needs to send a kidneyId as a query param which should be a number from 1-2(Humans only has 2 kidneys).
